				<h2 class="section-header">Summary</h2>
				<p>I've always loved coding and programming. I got my first
					experience with coding in 7th grade when I got my first TI-86
					calculator. I by no means ever became a TI-86 master programmer,
					but I had all sorts of little games and useful calculator utilities
					that I had written.</p>
				<p>In High School, I spent several years in EAST Lab. It was a
					fairly new program but it did get me exposed to several programs
					that were certainly out of my price range. I did some 3D modeling,
					photoshop and whatnot, but at the time I was mostly interested in
					learning Flash. I taught myself to make little movies and a good
					deal of action scripting, but once I didn't have access to a
					legitimate copy of flash I pretty much ended that.</p>
				<p>When I first started attending Hendrix, I was a Computer
					Science major. I had about 4 semesters that were mostly Java and
					then several classes that covered C, C++, HTML, and circuit
					building. When I decided to change over to UCA I also decided to
					change my major to Business Management, and graduated with a
					Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration in 2009.</p>
				<p>While I did enjoy the classes and everything I've done so far
					with the degree I have, I always regretted not staying on the
					coding/programming/development path. Years ago I read about the
					Arkansas Coding Academy opening and had always wanted to attend. In
					2018 my then-fiance pushed me to apply, which I did, and I attended
					their program from January through July of 2019.

				<p>
					As a class we wrote a single page web app to store and recall movie information. 
					The app had an HTML/Bootstrap/AngularJS front-end  which was responsive to screen 
					size, and a Java/SQL backend that  could CRUD our movie data in the SQL database 
					via the JDBC. We used the Jersey framework to write RESTful web services that 
					allowed our front and back end to communicate. As an added feature we used the AWS 
					SDK to create a simple notification service that automatically sent out emails and 
					text messages any time a new movie was added to the database. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For my class-end project I wrote a full-stack web app using technologies and a similar 
					structure used in the class movie app, to organize and manage Damgoode's catering 
					business which will be deployed online  and will stay in use even after I move on to a 
					new career.

					Above all I am a devoted husband and parent. We love to swim, cook, watch movies and TV, 
					and otherwise have as much family time together as we can. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I also attend and have presented in the Java User Group and spend time working on my own 
					programming projects both to entertain myself and to keep my skills sharp.
